# How to clean the mobile by removing bloatware and make it better efficient

It's become common trends for a mid range phone to have a lot of apps which is not good at all. For example I prefer VLC rather than phone's inbuild media app.
For working with adb you must have it in your PC. If you don't have it, download it from here https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r31.0.2-windows.zip
If you are on ubuntu, simply type `sudo apt install adb` in terminal.

Enjoy.
