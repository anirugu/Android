# How to clean the mobile by removing bloatware and make it more efficient
It's common for mid-range phones to come with many pre-installed apps, which can be unnecessary. For example, I prefer using VLC instead of the phone's built-in media app.

To use adb, you need to have it installed on your PC. If you don't have it, download it from [here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r31.0.2-windows.zip).

If you are on Ubuntu, simply run `sudo apt install adb` in the terminal.

Enjoy!
